Respository for program for Master Thesis.

Program is devided into few seperate files. The main file that needs to be run is named "index.py". 
Input data files needs to be placed into "Data" folder. The input data files should be additionaly placed in folders "Cooling" and "Heating" (To be changed soon).
Program asks user for column separator and decimal sign in numbers in data files.
Resulting data is put into "Results" folder.

Data to analyze comes from my own LabView program that runs electrical tests in dependace of temperature.
